**harvestacexchange** provides function to harvest [animalcrossingexchange.com](https://app.animalcrossingexchange.com).

## Installation

You can install from GitHub with:

# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("abichat/harvestacexchange")
```

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

```

When you install **harvestacexchange**, you need to install the JS dependencies once.

### Harvest

You can harvest turnips prices from `r url_turnips`

```{r turnips}
df_turnips <- turnips()
df_turnips
```

and list of events from `r url_events`

```{r events}
df_events <- events()
df_events
```

### Filter

**harvestacexchange** provides some useful filtering functions

```{r}
df_turnips %>% 
  filter_price_min(price_min = 500) %>% 
  filter_no_tag()

df_events %>% 
  filter_words("gold") %>% 
  filter_grade_min(grade_min = 90)
```

You can also compare these data to old versions and keep only the new lines with `filter_old_turnips()` and `filter_old_events()`.
